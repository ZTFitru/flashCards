# FlashCard  

## Abstract:

- This was the first solo project I was assigned to complete starting the second Mod at Turing. This app allows the user to play a flashcard game in the terminal. The user is presented with multiple answers or a true or false answer based on the questions presented in the terminal. If the user scores less than 90%, the game will display a message of the score and will continue to play until the user scores higher than 90%.

## Preview of App:
